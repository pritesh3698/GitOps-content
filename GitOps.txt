Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define and manage infrastructure through code, enabling version control, reproducibility, and automation.

Version Control: Track infrastructure changes using Git, providing a history of changes, facilitating collaboration, and enabling rollbacks if necessary.

Automation: Automate provisioning, updating, and deleting of infrastructure resources, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.

Collaboration: Teams can propose, review, and approve infrastructure changes through pull requests, ensuring thorough vetting before implementation.

Consistency and Standardization: Deploy infrastructure consistently across environments, reducing configuration drift and ensuring adherence to best practices.

Auditing and Compliance: Gain visibility into changes made to infrastructure for auditing and compliance purposes.

Risk Mitigation: Review and test changes before implementation, reducing the risk of unintended consequences or service disruptions.

Scalability: Scale infrastructure efficiently by defining reusable modules and templates for different environments.

Achievements using this setup include improved agility, reliability, and security in managing cloud infrastructure.
